# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

`swiss_bar` is a macOS menubar app (SDK: macosx, deployment target 26.5, Swift 5.0) bundling several independent utilities:

1. **Window switcher** — replaces Cmd+Tab with a switcher that cycles through windows instead of apps.
2. **Clipboard history** — records copied text/images (FlyCut-style), pastes via Cmd+Shift+V.
3. **Keyboard cleaning mode** — temporarily disables all keyboard input (for physically cleaning the keyboard).
4. **Network speed indicator** — shows live download/upload speed in the menubar.
5. **Claude usage indicator** — shows Claude usage (session, weekly, Fable 5 if present), similar to the Claude web app.

See `ROADMAP.md` for feature-by-feature build status. Features are being implemented one at a time.

The app is `LSUIElement` (agent app: no Dock icon, no app menu bar) and runs unsandboxed (`ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX` removed from the `swiss_bar` target) — several planned features (window switcher, keyboard cleaning mode) need a global `CGEventTap` and cross-process Accessibility (`AXUIElement`) control that don't work under App Sandbox. Distribution is via GitHub Releases, signed with a self-signed certificate (not an Apple Developer ID) — not the Mac App Store, not notarized. See `INSTALL.md` and `ROADMAP.md`'s Release section for why and how.

## Structure

- `swiss_bar/swiss_barApp.swift` — `@main` App entry point; `MenuBarExtra` scene hosting `MenuBarMenuView`, wired to `AppDelegate` via `@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor`.
- `swiss_bar/AppDelegate.swift` — owns feature-level singletons (event tap, overlay, permissions) and their lifecycle; wire new features in here.
- `swiss_bar/AccessibilityPermissionManager.swift` — tracks Accessibility/Input Monitoring TCC grant state, used by any feature needing global input/window access.
- `swiss_bar/MenuBarMenuView.swift` — the menu bar dropdown content. Rendered as a custom floating panel via `.menuBarExtraStyle(.window)` (set in `swiss_barApp.swift`), not a native `NSMenu` — needed so on/off state (e.g. keyboard cleaning) can show a real system switch instead of a checkmark. Rows close the panel explicitly (`NSApp.keyWindow?.close()`) before acting, to replicate native menu dismiss-on-click behavior.
- `swiss_bar/WindowSwitcher/` — window switcher feature (see `ROADMAP.md` for the architecture summary): `EventTapManager` (global Cmd+Tab interception), `WindowEnumerator`/`CandidateWindow` (AX-based window listing), `WindowActivator` (raise/focus), `SwitcherViewModel`/`OverlayController`/`SwitcherOverlayView` (the HUD). Each roadmap feature gets its own subdirectory like this one, isolated from the others.
- `swiss_bar/KeyboardCleaning/` — keyboard cleaning mode feature (see `ROADMAP.md`): `KeyboardCleaningManager`, a global `CGEventTap` that swallows keyboard input while active, toggled from a switch in the menu bar dropdown (no Settings tab).
- `swiss_bar/Assets.xcassets` — app icon and accent color assets.
- `swiss_barTests/` — unit tests using the Swift Testing framework (`import Testing`, `@Test` macro), not XCTest.
- `swiss_barUITests/` — UI tests using XCTest/XCUIApplication (launch and performance tests).

Note: the project uses Xcode's file-system-synchronized groups (`PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`) — new files placed under `swiss_bar/`, `swiss_barTests/`, or `swiss_barUITests/` are picked up automatically; there's no need to manually register them in `project.pbxproj`.

## Build, run, and test

This is an Xcode project (`swiss_bar.xcodeproj`) with a single scheme, `swiss_bar`.

Build and run from Xcode, or via `xcodebuild` from the command line:

```sh
# Build
xcodebuild -project swiss_bar.xcodeproj -scheme swiss_bar -configuration Debug build

# Run all tests (unit + UI)
xcodebuild test -project swiss_bar.xcodeproj -scheme swiss_bar -destination 'platform=macOS'

# Run a single unit test (Swift Testing)
xcodebuild test -project swiss_bar.xcodeproj -scheme swiss_bar -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -only-testing:swiss_barTests/swiss_barTests/example

# Run a single UI test (XCTest)
xcodebuild test -project swiss_bar.xcodeproj -scheme swiss_bar -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -only-testing:swiss_barUITests/swiss_barUITests/testExample
```

Note: `swiss_barTests` uses the Swift Testing framework (`@Test`), while `swiss_barUITests` uses XCTest (`XCTestCase`) — the two are not interchangeable and use different assertion styles (`#expect` vs. `XCTAssert*`).
